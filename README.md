# New Language (Name TBD)

Custom programming language for learning purposes. Written in C++.


Syntax Rules (WIP):

	Identifier (variable name, function name, etc.):

	Integers:

	Keyword (if, else, etc):
		if
		for-loop:
			do i = 1,25 {} // Loop until i == 25, starting at 1. I is automatically set to an integer
		when

	Whitespace (\t, spaces, \n):

	Paraenthesis (Open and closed are seperate syntax rules):

	semi-colon OR new-line:
		ends statement
		new-line is hardcoded in
